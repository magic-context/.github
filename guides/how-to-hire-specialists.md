# How to Hire AI Specialists - Complete Guide

## Overview

"Hiring" an AI specialist in Magic Context means creating a personal instance of a specialist template that becomes your dedicated AI assistant for a specific domain. Unlike starting fresh with generic AI each time, hired specialists maintain persistent memory about your preferences, patterns, and progress.

- **Specialist Templates** (modules): Reusable blueprints defining roles, capabilities, and structure

1. Creates a personal copy of the specialist template
